      <p class="aboutText">This project is very personal for me. When I immigrated to the United States in 2019, I struggled with balancing my Haitian identity and culture while learning about American identity and culture. Slowly but surely I was fortunately able to assimilate, because I had a good support system, but there are people I know that were not so lucky. They continued to struggle and took even more time to fully integrate themselves into American society. With this website we hope to lessen the rate at which this continues, providing a helping hand for those that don't have one. Outside of this project, I like to volunteer in various organizations to help my community in any way I can.</p>

      <p class="aboutText">Hi, I am a junior at School for Advanced Studies- North. In my role as website editor and writer, I worked to gather data, pictures, articles, and firsthand stories about the problems immigrants, such as my parents, faced when adjusting to life in America. By developing the AI Chatbot, Project GEM helped me gain experience with Microsoft Azure, HTML, and CSS, as well as learn from and collaborate with my teammates. When I'm not coding, I also enjoy reading, playing chess, and math.

         </p>
      <p class="aboutText">I am the child of immigrants who came to the United States in search of opportunity for themselves and their children. Our goal with this website resonated with me because I know what it is like to watch people you care about adapt to living and working in a completely new country. Although I have limited knowledge about programming and computer science, I enjoyed challenging myself with this project. Outside of computer science, I like to make and listen to music.</p>

    <p class="aboutText">My name is Michelle Mendez and I am a junior at SAS. My role as an editor, writer, and researcher allowed me gain vasts amounts of knowledge, which I was able to share with my immigrant family members and others going through the immigration process. My interest in computer science grew due to this project, which really helped me see another side of computer science that I found extremely interesting.</p>

      <p class="aboutText">Hello, I’m a junior at School for Advanced Studies. I wanted to help with this project because I felt immigrants did not have nearly enough resources to help them. While I don’t have much experience in computer science, I’m enjoying it and look forward to learning more. When I’m not learning computer science, I like to read and draw.</p>
